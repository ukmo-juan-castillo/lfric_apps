Guide to the documentation
--------------------------
The LFRic Apps documentation is split into a number of main sections. This is
the :ref:`Getting Started <getting_started_index>` section which contains
information on the dependencies required to run any of the LFRic based
applications including those found in LFRic Core.
The :ref:`User Guide <user_guide_index>` describes the purpose of the 
applications and how to use them.
The :ref:`Science Guide <science_guide_index>` describes the various
science schemes implemented and used in the modelling applications.
The :ref:`Developer Guide <developer_guide_index>`
contains guidance for those doing development of the applications themselves.

For initial orientation, a :ref:`quick overview <repository_contents>` of the
main contents of the LFRic Apps repository is given. As noted, the LFRic Core
code is stored in a separate repository.

A :ref:`Glossary of Terms <glossary_of_terms>` defines commonly used terms and
is available from the right-hand side panel of each page.
