  !>        or derived from LFRic inputs.
  !>@details Nothing in this file is ever likely to be promoted to the LFRic
  !>          namelist. Everything is either set from an LFRic variable
  !>          already in the namelist, or is "fixed" from the perspective
  !>          of LFRic (but cannot be made a parameter because it is required
  !>          to be variable in the UM and therefore declared as such in the
  !>          UM modules which contains it).
  !> @param[in] ncells  The number of cells in the horizontal domain that
  !>                    the UM code should loop over (i.e. not including halos)
