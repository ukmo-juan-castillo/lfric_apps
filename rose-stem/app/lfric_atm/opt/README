Guide to optional configs

Optional configs should be applied in the following order:
- The horizontal mesh will always apply first.
- The rest apply in the order they appear on the "opt_confs" line.
This order allows that configuration specifics can override anything, idealised
case descriptions can override science settings, and science settings can
override grid specific information.

Horizontal mesh information:
- C12 - C12 mesh with low resolution requirements such as no multigrid
- C48, C192, C224, C256, C512 - standard mesh information - includes radiation
                                timesteps and dep_pt_stencil_extent appropriate
                                for resolution
- C768, C896 - standard mesh information, plus low resolution aerosol and
               ozone ancillaries
- BiP2x2-50000x50000 - SCM mesh, setup with no dynamics
- BiP64x64-100x100_MG, BiP64x64-250x250_MG, BiP64x64-500x500_MG,
  BiP64x64-1500x1500_MG - various resolution bicyclic lam domains
- seuk_MG - small UK LBC forced LAM, with input files and date
- uk_MG - UK LBC forced LAM (648 x 648), with input files and date
- uk_672x672_MG - UK LBC forced LAM (672x672), with input files and date
- ukv_MG - variable resolution UK LBC forced LAM, with input files and date
- comp_perf_MG - UK computational performance domain, with input files and date
- melbourne_MG - Melbourne LBC forced LAM, with input files and date

Vertical mesh information:
- l85_85km - standard climate level set
- l70_40km - standard high-resolution level set
- l38_40km - old level set, still used for idealised and exoplanet runs
- l66_4000km/9000km - uniform level sets used for exoplanet runs
- l110_4p4km - high resolution level set used for idealised runs
