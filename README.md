# LFRic Apps

Welcome to LFRic Apps!

This repository is home to the LFRic-based science applications and libraries such as
the Momentum&reg; Atmosphere model application and the GungHo dynamical core.

LFRic applications are based on the infrastructure developed in the [LFRic
Core](https://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_core) repository.

## Getting Started

In development documentation for LFRic Apps is available at:
[https://metoffice.github.io/lfric_apps](https://metoffice.github.io/lfric_apps)

The LFRic Apps release schedule and deadlines can be viewed in the [milestones](https://github.com/metoffice/lfric_apps/milestones).

Example standalone scientific suites for use with Met Office systems are
available at:

* [u-dn674 - MetOffice Azure SPICE](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/roses-u/browser/d/n/6/7/4/trunk)
* [u-dn704 - MetOffice EX HPC](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/roses-u/browser/d/n/7/0/4/trunk)

These both run a low resolution LFRic Atm NWP GAL9 job and are setup to run
using git sources. Advice on switching a suite from using fcm to git sources is
available in the README.md in each.
